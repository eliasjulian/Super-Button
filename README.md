A Framer X Component w/ JSON superpowers

### This is a WIP, but here's what I'm planning—
* No more recreating that all-too-common top right corner button interaction
* On click the nav bkg grows down while staying on the same page, giving space to show a set of features, products, a menu 👀
* Main override is the ability to connect a JSON file to the component which is where that list of features, products, etc. in the dropdown can be pulled from
* Might include some preset animations for speed/bounce,

### Release plans
* v1 nails the responsive behavior across browser sizes, button hover, click 👉 grow down w/ screen content darken
* v1.1 adds feature to have content inside growdown pulled from json file and the overflow is horizontally scrollable
